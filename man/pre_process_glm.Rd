\usage{
pre_process_glm(x, ...)

\S4method{pre_process_glm}{syndromicW}(x, slot = "observed",
  syndromes = NULL, family = "poisson", formula = "trend+sin+cos",
  frequency = 52, print.model = TRUE, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a syndromic (\code{syndromicD} or \code{syndromicW})
 object, which must have at least
the slot of observed data and a data frame in the slot dates.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to the method.}

\item{slot}{the slot in the \code{syndromic} object to be processed,
by default, "observed", but this argument can be used to
change it to "baseline"}

\item{syndromes}{an optional parameter, if not specified, all
columns in the slot observed (or baseline if that
was chosen in the previous parameter) of the \code{syndromic} object
will be used. The user can choose to restrict the analyses to
a few syndromic groups listing their name or column position
in the observed matrix. See examples.}

\item{family}{the GLM distribution family used, by default
"poisson". if "nbinom" is used, the function
glm.nb is used instead.}

\item{formula}{the regression formula to be used. The following arguments
are accepted for DAILY data (\code{syndromicD} class objects provided):
trend (for a monotonic trend), year, month, dow (day of week),
sin, cos, Ar1 (auto-regressive for 1 days) to AR7. For WEEKLY data
(\code{syndromicW} class objects provided): trend, sin, cos, year and 1 to 4
autoregressive variables.
These elements can be combined
into any formula. The default for DAILY data is
formula="dow+sin+cos+Ar1+Ar2+AR3+AR4+AR5" and for WEEKLY data
"trend+sin+cos" See examples.}

\item{frequency}{in case pre-processing is applied using "glm" AND the sin/cos functions
are used, the cycle of repetitions need to be set. The default is a year
(365 days or 52 weeks).}

\item{print.model}{whether the result of model fitting should be
printed on the console. This is recommended when the user is
exploring which dependent variables to keep or drop.}

\item{plot}{whether plots comparing observed data and the result of
the pre-processing should be displayed.}
}
\value{
A matrix with all the pre-processed vectors.
}
\description{
Function to remove known temporal effects from time series. It fits
a glm model to the time series, and delivers the residuals.
}
\details{
This function is provided for users interested in capturing
(saving or plotting) the results of this pre-processing step.
However, in the context of syndromic
surveillance through objects of the class syndromic (\code{syndromicD} or \code{syndromicW}),
pre-processing is performed in conjunction with the application of
control-charts, saving results into an object of the
class \code{syndromic} (D or W) (within
detection algorithms. - See ewma_synd(), shew_synd() and cusum_synd())
